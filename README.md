Materials used:
10μF Capacitors, Various Resistors (2k, 10k, 30k, 100k Ohms), 741 Op-Amp, Breadboard, Wires, Oscilloscope, Function generator, Voltage source

Adding resistance:

We observed that adding resistance did not affect the output signal, hence the “buffer” amplifier. This amplifier has a good real-world use, by preventing the load from affecting the source.
